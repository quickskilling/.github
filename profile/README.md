# Quick Skilling

This organization focuses on repositories that introduce new technical topics. Our skilling developers range from experts in the field to students that want to demonstrate their expertise.  

Additionally, we pull repositories from around Github that demonstrate great quick skilling.

## _What is quick skilling?_

Quick skill training is much different than the type of training received as a student in college. These professional pieces of training are meant to quickly provide an introduction, workable code snippets, and ways to push deeper after one or two hours. Quick skilling has a small set of learning goals that to help the student get over the early-stage hurdles of the new technology. 

## _Who is served by this matterial?_

Professionals in the respective industry of the course. However, the professional may be a _"freshmen"_ concerning the latest technology in the quick skill course.

## _What guidance should the quick skill developers know?_

These learners will surprise you with the depth of their questions as well as the shallowness of their abilities. You need to be prepared to keep the material simple but have the background knowledge to clearly answer any depth questions that arise. This preparation requires you to have built an experience with the tool that would allow you to teach advanced material on the topic while staying focused on introductory teaching goals.

In college courses, our learning experiences are within a classroom that meets multiple times weekly for numerous months. That is often one part of a larger degree where multiple principles are taught beyond the technical tools of a new software package or technique. You have probably experienced a few different teaching styles from your professors. Your short course mustn't be a 60-minute long lecture! Additionally, it is crucial that you take ownership of the material and that you provide clear examples that help the students use the new technology. They wouldn't have come to your short course if they wanted to learn independently.
